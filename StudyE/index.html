          Flashcards are a versatile study tool that can be used for simple facts as well as complex processes
          throughout one’s academic career. They are effective because they leverage the learning power of active
          recall, metacognition, and spaced repetition. Active recall is when you try to retrieve information from
          memory. Flashcards engage metacognition by allowing you to monitor your own learning and adjust your study
          strategies accordingly. Flashcards allow for confidence-based repetition which means that you can repeat the
          cards that you don’t know as well more frequently than those that you do know well. </td>

      Note Taking.
    </h2>

    <br />
    <table>

        <td>

          Note-taking promotes positive memory as well as the ability to retain information because the mind becomes an
          active component in studying. It also helps you grasp more information in than what you normally would as you
          actively paying attention to what is being taught.
          <br />
          <br />
          When you take notes, you’re processing information. You’re highlighting facts, connecting the dots, and
          breaking down a big topic into small chunks. Engaging actively with the information increases chances of
          recollecting some if not all of it later on

          Creating a study timetable can help you plan your study schedule and make the most of your time. It can help
          you stay organized and focused on your studies, which can lead to better grades and less stress. A study
          timetable can also help you identify areas where you need to spend more time studying and areas where you can
          afford to spend less time.
          <br /><br />
          In addition, creating a study timetable can help you develop good time management skills. By setting aside
          specific times for studying, you can avoid procrastination and ensure that you have enough time to complete
          all of your assignments and prepare for exams.
